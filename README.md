Welcome to **Galite**, the framework of [kopiLeft](https://github.com/kopiLeft) with an expressive elegant syntax based on Kotlin DSL to create great applications.

## Purpose
Since development must be as creative and enjoyable as doing common tasks, Galite provides all the needed tools for developers to take the pain out of designing and implementing applications.

Galite allows users to build business applications with forms, reports and charts using a simple, creative and specific syntax that will allow you to put all the verbosity aside and concentrate on the business logic with its simple domain specific language.

## Advantages
Galite offers many advantages:
* Kotlin-based DSL: using Type-Safe builders for building the application components through the simple declaration of the forms, reports or charts in the DSL.
* Database-backed application: it provides you with the feature of connecting forms with databases and getting queries from different database dialects. You declare the database tables using [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) framework.
* Strongly typed fields: you have to declare the data types of fields explicitly, which allows to check the type of data assigned to a field at compile-time.

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome.

If the idea excites you and you want to add a new patch or feature, feel free to submit a pull request.
