Welcome to GALITE, the new framework of [kopiLeft](https://github.com/kopiLeft) with expressive, elegant syntax, based on Kotlin, DSL.

Galite allows users to build business applications with forms, reports and charts using a simple, creative and specific syntax that will allow you to put all the verbosity aside and concentrate on the business logic with itâ€™s simple domain specific language . 

## PURPOSE
Since development must be as creative and enjoyable as doing common tasks, GALITE provides all the needed tools for developers to take the pain out of designing and implementing applications.
It is a framework basically, that help them create forms to enter their data, reports and charts for visualizing them, all to control their stocks and items.

## Advanatages

Galite offers many advantages:
* Kotlin-based DSL: using Type-Safe builders for building the application components through the simple declaration of the forms, reports or charts in the Dsl. 
* Data from database: it provides you with the feature of connecting forms with databases, building reports and charts, getting queries from different database dialects without any further configurations. 
* Strongly typed fields: you have to declare the data types of fields explicitly, which allows to checks the type of data assigned to a field at compile-time.
